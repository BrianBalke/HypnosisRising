The Hypnosis Rising Case Recorder is a tool for capturing the essential content of a session.

<h2>Principles of Hypnotherapy</h2>

As promoted by Carl Jung and demonstrated so wonderfully by Milton Erickson, therapy must meet the client where they are. Terms, goals, and methods must be familiar and comfortable. Of course, as therapy entrains personal growth, those three elements evolve over time.

Hypnotherapy has historically been seen as a method for suppressing uncomfortable behaviors. Many therapists will record trance work for reinforcement between sessions. The limitation of this practice is that encountered by Freud. The subconscious mind (managing our well-being) depends upon the conscious mind for direction. If the client does not <em>understand</em> why specific changes are beneficial, ultimately the subconscious will discount the authority of the therapist, with subsequent recidivism.

While the therapist's session notes often contain that rationale, they also include honest assessments of client behavior that should be held in reserve.

<h2>Trance Process</h2>

The power of hypnotherapy is found in the trance state. Trance is a natural state, often arising in pleasurable circumstances (at a movie theater or with a romantic partner). When in trance, the entire mind processes experience. Challenges often arise in crisis, when the mind discovers new methods for securing survival. Those methods, tapping into powerful primitive resources, may be pushed forward in situations that generate <em>similar</em> emotions, with personally and socially undesirable consequences.

A well-trained hypnotherapist recognizes the imbalances in the client's behavior pattern and applies specific methods to restore balance.
